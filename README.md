# group-finder
A web development pet project of mine meant to be used by Oldschool RuneScape players to quickly find others for group activities in-game, never completely finished it since the Oldschool RuneScape developers implemented a similar feature into the game making this project redundant.  I recently picked it back up again to finish the home-page and add some polish so it could be a portfolio piece.
